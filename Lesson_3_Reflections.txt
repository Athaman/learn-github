When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories would be great for collaborating as a team, sharing your content with a broader audience, or just
to use as portability across devices. Local storage would be better for privacy and security as well as to avoid confusion 
while a new project is in development and not release ready.
