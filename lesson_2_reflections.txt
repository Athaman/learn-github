What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository creates the hidden .git folder which holds the meta data
for the git system. This is where the old versions and logs are maintained.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area gives us an opportunity to test what changes we've made without actually
committing them. It provides us an opportunity to consider the package before
we commit the repository.
